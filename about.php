		<p>Radio Voice of Naija is the registered trade name for our media communication channel dedicated to helping disseminate relevant and helpful information to the  (African) migrant community. Our primary goal is to inform, educate and empower the migrant to succeed within the context of his/her environment, regardless of their personal, racial and financial circumstances. Because ignorance of one’s environment is often a major contributory factor to failure to overcome one’s limitations, there is a felt need to eliminate this obstacle through sourcing and disseminating helpful information, so that migrants can succeed and contribute to the building up of their newly adopted home countries. For this purpose we use both broadcasting, electronic and other relevant media to reach our target group. We also organise community events and activities in line with our goals.
		We are a non-profit charitable organisation supported by free-will gifts, donations and subsidies. You are welcome to give any donation to support our work. </p>
